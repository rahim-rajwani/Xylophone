# Xylophone

A beautifully tuned percussion instrument spanning one octave. This incredibly colourful musical instrument with 7 note bars is lovely to play and listen to. Children can explore melody and pitch contour, and build eye-hand co-ordination and bi-lateral hand movement while playing this xylophone.
